First Heuristic - 3D Manhattan.
		For S, L, Ma, Mb < 20 as nested loops in that order. 160000 discrete states.
		Test cancelled due to excessive compute time.
			

Second Heuristic.
	For S, L, Ma, Mb < 20 as nested loops in that order. 160000 discrete states.
		Starting at Truck: 
		
			Max Uncertainty = -1
			Sum Uncertainty = -82670
			Average Uncertainty = -82670/160000 = -0.5166875
			
		Starting at WarehouseA:
			MaxUncertainty = -2
			Sum Uncertainty = -84019/160000 = -0.52511875
			Average uncertainty = -84019/160000 = -0.52511875
			
			
Running the above tests on Heuristic 2, CPU usage hovered around 19~22%, and memory usage was well under 700MB (Less than Chrome at the time). No single core was particularly taxed.
For heuristic one, it pushed the CPU consistently to 87~92%, and memory usage to just under 2.2 GB. All cores were pushed to around 90%.
This was total CPU utilisation, across all 6 Logical cores for both.


For S, L, Ma, Mb <5 as nested loops in that order. 625 discrete states. All start at WarehouseA.
